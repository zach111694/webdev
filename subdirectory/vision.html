</div>

<section id="vision">
  <p>MolloyLife has grown tremendously within the last 2 years, and our growth will increase exponentially within the next 5 years. This includes a larger staff, increased staff development, larger and more suitable space, current equipment, and increased awareness of our brand on campus.</p>
  <p>To do so, MolloyLife will be targeting Freshman students at the onset of their time at Molloy College, which includes informational seminars and information sessions at Molloy College's orientations and open houses. In addition, MolloyLife intends to increase our presence on campus to current students through constant video streaming on the various video sources throughout the college, increased social media presence, and further participation within the Molloy Community.</p>
  <p>
    To connect to the Molloy College faculty and the various departments present on campus, MolloyLife will reach out to major programs to form a collaborative bond that benefits both parties immensely. Such bonds have already been formed the New Media Department through cross-content sharing and production, and further bonds can be formed with departments such as the English, Business and Education Department through internship opportunities and technological partnerships.</p> 
    <p>Ultimately, our goal as an organization is to become more powerful on the Molloy College campus. To do so, an equal amount of support from the Presidential and Executive College Board is a necessity for MolloyLife's continued success. To provide students with unmatched experience within a media organization - to exemplify the outstanding campus life - to increase the awareness of Molloy College and the #Molloylife is the overall vision of MolloyLife Media, and it is a vision we intend to fulfill through the continued efforts of our dedicated staff and editors, and the mantra of thinking big to achieve big goals.</p>
